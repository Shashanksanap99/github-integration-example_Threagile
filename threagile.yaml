business_overview:
  description: A scalable and secure network is offered by AWS infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS).It guarantees a robust architecture strong enough to support important parts like databases and application servers. This architecture serves companies looking for a stable, flexible, and secure cloud-based environment to support their operations by enabling dependable application hosting and effective database management.

technical_overview:
  description: AWS network infrastructure configures a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with defined CIDR blocks, enabling DNS support and hostnames. The setup includes public and private subnets across multiple availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance.Key components of this setup include an internet gateway for external connectivity, route tables to manage traffic flow within the VPC,and security groups to control access to instances. The infrastructure comprises various instances a Linux bastion host in the public subnet for secure SSH access,an application server in the private subnet, and a database instance with security group.

security_requirements:
  Input Validation: Strict input validation is required to reduce the overall attack surface.
  Securing Administrative Access: Administrative access must be secured with strong encryption and multi-factor authentication.

# NOTE:
# For risk tracking each risk-id needs to be defined (the string with the @ sign in it). These unique risk IDs
# are visible in the PDF report (the small grey string under each risk), the Excel (column "ID"), as well as the JSON responses.
# Some risk IDs have only one @ sign in them, while others multiple. The idea is to allow for unique but still speaking IDs.
# Therefore each risk instance creates its individual ID by taking all affected elements causing the risk to be within an @-delimited part.
# Using wildcards (the * sign) for parts delimited by @ signs allows to handle groups of certain risks at once. Best is to lookup the IDs
# to use in the created Excel file. Alternatively a model macro "seed-risk-tracking" is available that helps in initially
# seeding the risk tracking part here based on already identified and not yet handled risks.
