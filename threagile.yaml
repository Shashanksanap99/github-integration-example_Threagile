  IAC CloudFormation facilitates the creation of a AWS architecture consist of VPC with defined public and private subnets across multiple availability zones. 
  

business_criticality: important

business_overview:
  description: A scalable and secure network is offered by AWS infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS).It guarantees a robust architecture strong enough to support important parts like databases and application servers. This architecture serves companies looking for a stable, flexible, and secure cloud-based environment to support their operations by enabling dependable application hosting and effective database management.

technical_overview:
  description: AWS network infrastructure configures a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with defined CIDR blocks, enabling DNS support and hostnames. The setup includes public and private subnets across multiple availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance.Key components of this setup include an internet gateway for external connectivity, route tables to manage traffic flow within the VPC,and security groups to control access to instances. The infrastructure comprises various instances a Linux bastion host in the public subnet for secure SSH access,an application server in the private subnet, and a database instance with security group.

abuse_cases:
  Denial-of-Service: >
    As a hacker I want to disturb the functionality of the backend system in order to cause indirect
    financial damage via unusable features.
  Ransomware: >
    As a hacker I want to encrypt the storage and file systems in order to demand ransom.
  Identity Theft: >
    As a hacker I want to steal identity data in order to reuse credentials and/or keys on other targets of the same company or outside.
  PII Theft: >
    As a hacker I want to steal PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data in order to blackmail the company and/or damage
    their repudiation by publishing them.
  AWS-System Compromise: >
    As a hacker I want to access the VPC System in order to steal/modify sensitive business data.
  Database Compromise: >
    As a hacker I want to access the database backend of the rds-Subnet in order to steal/modify sensitive
    business data.
  Cross-Site Scripting Attacks: >
    As a hacker I want to execute Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and similar attacks in order to takeover victim sessions and
    cause reputational damage.
  Denial-of-Service of Enduser Functionality: >
    As a hacker I want to disturb the functionality of the enduser parts of the application in order to cause direct financial
    damage.
  Denial-of-Service of DB Functionality: >
    As a hacker I want to disturb the functionality of the Database system to cause indirect
    financial damage.

security_requirements:
  Input Validation: Strict input validation is required to reduce the overall attack surface.
  Securing Administrative Access: Administrative access must be secured with strong encryption and multi-factor authentication.
